# AstroPaper 📄

AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive, accessible and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. This theme is designed and crafted based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme follows best practices and provides accessibility out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by default. Moreover, additional color schemes can also be configured.
